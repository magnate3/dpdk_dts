VEB Switch and floating VEB Tests
=================================

VEB Switching Introduction
==========================

IEEE EVB tutorial:
http://www.ieee802.org/802_tutorials/2009-11
/evb-tutorial-draft-20091116_v09.pdf

Virtual Ethernet Bridge (VEB) - This is an IEEE EVB term. A VEB is a VLAN
Bridge internal to Fortville that bridges the traffic of multiple VSIs over
an internal virtual network.

Virtual Ethernet Port Aggregator (VEPA) - This is an IEEE EVB term. A VEPA
multiplexes the traffic of one or more VSIs onto a single Fortville Ethernet
port. The biggest difference between a VEB and a VEPA is that a VEB can
switch packets internally between VSIs, whereas a VEPA cannot.

Virtual Station Interface (VSI) - This is an IEEE EVB term that defines
the properties of a virtual machine's (or a physical machine's) connection
to the network. Each downstream v-port on a Fortville VEB or VEPA defines
a VSI. A standards-based definition of VSI properties enables network
management tools to perform virtual machine migration and associated network
re-configuration in a vendor-neutral manner.

My understanding of VEB is that it's an in-NIC switch(MAC/VLAN), and it can
support VF->VF, PF->VF, VF->PF packet forwarding according to the NIC internal
switch. It's similar as Niantic's SRIOV switch.

Floating VEB Introduction
=========================

Floating VEB is based on VEB Switching. It will address 2 problems:

Dependency on PF: When the physical port is link down, the functionality of
the VEB/VEPA will not work normally. Even only data forwarding between the VF
is required, one PF port will be wasted to create the related VEB.

Ensure all the traffic from VF can only forwarding within the VFs connect
to the floating VEB, cannot forward to the outside world.

Prerequisites for VEB testing
=============================

1. Get the pci device id of DUT, for example::

       ./dpdk-devbind.py --st
       0000:05:00.0 'Ethernet Controller X710 for 10GbE SFP+' if=ens785f0 drv=i40e
       unused=

2. Host PF in kernel driver. Create 2 VFs from 1 PF with kernel driver, and
   set the VF MAC address at PF::

       echo 2 > /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000\:05\:00.0/sriov_numvfs
       ./dpdk-devbind.py --st

       0000:05:02.0 'XL710/X710 Virtual Function' unused=
       0000:05:02.1 'XL710/X710 Virtual Function' unused=

       ip link set ens785f0 vf 0 mac 00:11:22:33:44:11
       ip link set ens785f0 vf 1 mac 00:11:22:33:44:12

3. Host PF in DPDK driver. Create 2VFs from 1 PF with dpdk driver::

       ./dpdk-devbind.py -b igb_uio 05:00.0
       echo 2 >/sys/bus/pci/devices/0000:05:00.0/max_vfs
       ./dpdk-devbind.py --st
       0000:05:02.0 'XL710/X710 Virtual Function' unused=i40evf,igb_uio
       0000:05:02.1 'XL710/X710 Virtual Function' unused=i40evf,igb_uio

4. Bind the VFs to dpdk driver::

       ./tools/dpdk-devbind.py -b igb_uio 05:02.0 05:02.1

5. Reserve huge pages memory(before using DPDK)::

       echo 4096 > /sys/devices/system/node/node0/hugepages/hugepages-2048kB
       /nr_hugepages
       mkdir /mnt/huge
       mount -t hugetlbfs nodev /mnt/huge


Test Case1: Floating VEB inter VF-VF
====================================

Summary: 1 DPDK PF, then create 2VF, PF in the host running dpdk testpmd,
and VF0 are running dpdk testpmd, VF0 send traffic, and set the packet's
DEST MAC to VF1, check if VF1 can receive the packets. Check Inter VF-VF
MAC switch when PF is link down as well as up.

1. Launch PF testpmd::

      ./testpmd -c 0xf -n 4 --socket-mem 1024,1024
      -w 05:00.0,enable_floating_veb=1 --file-prefix=test1 -- -i

2. In the host, run testpmd with floating parameters and make the link down::

      ./testpmd -c 0xf -n 4 --socket-mem 1024,1024
      -w 05:00.0,enable_floating_veb=1 --file-prefix=test1 -- -i
      testpmd> port start all
      testpmd> show port info all

3. In VM1, run testpmd::

      ./testpmd -c 0xf0 -n 4 --socket-mem 1024,1024
      -w 05:02.0 --file-prefix=test2 -- -i --crc-strip
      testpmd>mac_addr add 0 vf1_mac_address
      testpmd>set fwd rxonly
      testpmd>start
      testpmd>show port stats all

   In VM2, run testpmd::

      ./testpmd -c 0xf00 -n 4 --socket-mem 1024,1024 -w 05:02.1 --file-prefix=test3
      -- -i --crc-strip --eth-peer=0,vf1_mac_address
      testpmd>set fwd txonly
      testpmd>start
      testpmd>show port stats all

4. Check if VF1 can get all the packets. Check the packet content is no
   corrupted. RX-packets=TX-packets, but there is a little RX-error.
   RF receive no packets.

5. Set "testpmd> port stop all" and "testpmd> start" in step2,
   then run the step3-4 again. same result.


Test Case2: Floating VEB PF can't get traffic from VF
=====================================================
DPDK PF, then create 1VF, PF in the host running dpdk testpmd,
send traffic from PF to VF0, VF0 can't receive any packets;
send traffic from VF0 to PF, PF can't receive any packets either.


1. In host, launch testpmd::

      ./testpmd -c 0x3 -n 4 -w 82:00.0,enable_floating_veb=1 -- -i
      testpmd> set fwd rxonly
      testpmd> port start all
      testpmd> start
      testpmd> show port stats all

3. In VM1, run testpmd::

      ./testpmd -c 0x3 -n 4 -- -i --eth-peer=0,pf_mac_addr
      testpmd>set fwd txonly
      testpmd>start
      testpmd>show port stats all

4. Check if PF can not get any packets, so VF1->PF is not working.

5. Set "testpmd> port stop all" in step2, then run the test case again.
   Same result.



Test Case3 Floating VEB VF can't receive traffic from outside world
===================================================================

      testpmd> start
      testpmd> show port stats all


   In VM1, run testpmd::

      ./testpmd -c 0x3 -n 4 -- -i

       testpmd>set fwd rxonly
       testpmd>start
       testpmd>show port stats all

   In tester, run scapy::

      packet=Ether(dst="VF_mac_address")/IP()/UDP()/Raw('x'*20)
      sendp(packet,iface="enp132s0f0")

3. Check if VF1 can not get any packets, so tester->VF1 is not working.
4. Set "testpmd> port stop all" in step2 in Host, then run the test case
   again. same result.PF can't receive any packets.

      testpmd>set fwd txonly
      testpmd>start
      testpmd>show port stats all

   Check VF1 can not get any packets, so VF2->VF1 is not working.

6. Set "testpmd> port start all" and "testpmd> start" in step2,
   then run the step3-5 again. same result.


Test Case5: PF interaction with Floating VF and legacy VF
=========================================================
DPDK PF, then create 2VFs, VF0 is in floating VEB, VF1 is in legacy VEB.

1. Send traffic from VF0 to PF, then check PF will not see any traffic;
2. Send traffic from VF1 to PF, then check PF will receive all the packets.
3. send traffic from tester to VF0, check VF0 can't receive traffic from
   tester.
4. send traffic from tester to VF1, check VF1 can receive all the traffic
   from tester.

5. In host, launch testpmd::

      ./testpmd -c 0x3 -n 4
       -w 82:00.0,enable_floating_veb=1,floating_veb_list=0 -- -i
      testpmd> set fwd rxonly
      testpmd> port start all
      testpmd> start

      testpmd>set fwd txonly
      testpmd>start
      testpmd>show port stats all

   Check PF can not get any packets, so VF1->PF is not working.

7. In VF2, run testpmd::

      ./testpmd -c 0x3 -n 4 -- -i --eth-peer=0,pf_mac_addr
      testpmd>set fwd txonly
      testpmd>start
      testpmd>show port stats all

      Check PF can get all the packets, so VF2->PF is working.

8. Set "testpmd> port stop all" in step2 in Host,
   then run the test case again. same result.

9. In host, launch testpmd::

      ./testpmd -c 0x3 -n 4
       -w 82:00.0,enable_floating_veb=1,floating_veb_list=0 -- -i
      testpmd> set fwd mac
      testpmd> port start all
      testpmd> start
      testpmd> show port stats all


10. In VF1, run testpmd::

      ./testpmd -c 0x3 -n 4 -- -i
       testpmd>show port info all       //get VF1_mac_address
       testpmd>set fwd rxonly
       testpmd>start
       testpmd>show port stats all

   In tester, run scapy::

      packet=Ether(dst="VF1_mac_address")/IP()/UDP()/Raw('x'*20)
      sendp(packet,iface="enp132s0f0")

   Check VF1 can not get any packets, so tester->VF1 is not working.

11. In VF2, run testpmd::

      ./testpmd -c 0x3 -n 4 -- -i
       testpmd>show port info all       //get VF2_mac_address
       testpmd>set fwd rxonly
       testpmd>start
       testpmd>show port stats all

   In tester, run scapy::

      packet=Ether(dst="VF2_mac_address")/IP()/UDP()/Raw('x'*20)
      sendp(packet,iface="enp132s0f0")

   Check VF1 can get all the packets, so tester->VF2 is working.

12. Set "testpmd> port stop all" in step2 in Host, then run the test case
    again.  VF1 and VF2 cannot receive any packets. (because PF link down, and
    PF can't receive any packets. so even if VF2 can't receive any packets.)
