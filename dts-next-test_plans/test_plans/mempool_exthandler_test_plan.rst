External Mempool Handler Tests
==============================

External Mempool Handler feature is an extension to the mempool API that
allows users to add and use an alternative mempool handler, which allows
external memory subsystems such as external hardware memory management
systems and software based memory allocators to be used with DPDK.

Test Case 1: Multiple producers and multiple consumers mempool handler
======================================================================

1. Change default mempool operation to "ring_mp_mc"
2. Run l2fwd and check packet forwarding normally with this mempool handler.

Test Case 2: Single producer and Single consumer mempool handler
================================================================

1. Change default mempool operation to "ring_sp_sc"
2. Run l2fwd and check packet forwarding normally with this mempool handler.

Test Case 3: Single producer and Multiple consumers mempool handler
===================================================================

1. Change default mempool operation to "ring_sp_mc"
2. Run l2fwd and check packet forwarding normally with this mempool handler.

Test Case 4: Multiple producers and single consumer mempool handler
===================================================================

1. Change default mempool operation to "ring_mp_sc"
2. Run l2fwd and check packet forwarding normally with this mempool handler.

Test Case 5: External stack mempool handler
===========================================

1. Change default mempool operation to "stack"
2. Run l2fwd and check packet forwarding normally with this mempool handler.
